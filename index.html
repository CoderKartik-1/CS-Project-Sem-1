			 <h1 class="display-4" style="color: orange;">IMPORTANCE OF VOTING IN INDIA</h1>
			 <h2 class="lead">Every Single Vote Is Significant:</h2>
			 <p>Needless to say, every citizen’s vote is counted in the polling process. If the people are equally divided between two<br>
				candidates, one single vote can be a game-changer and a decisive factor. We have seen in the past how one vote from an MP<br>
				can decide the fall of the government. Exactly the same way, a single person’s vote can confirm the win/fall of an aspiring MP<br>
			    or MLA.<br>
			 </p>
			 <h2 class="lead">Origin of the Change:</h2>
			 <p>Apart from the protests, voting is a highly effective medium to have the change that we want in the government. Our nation<br>
			    has already witnessed how a non-performing government gets dethroned by the spirit of wanting a change. In recent years,<br>
			    there is a considerable rise in the voting percentage and people are truly loving to be the ‘Change Makers’. Isn’t it exciting<br>
			    that a person can choose the leader of the country right from the age of 18?</p>
			 <h2 class="lead">Non-choosers get NOTA:</h2>
			 <p>At times, it is possible that one does not want any single candidate to be elected from all who are contesting. The election<br>
			    commission has made a special provision of NOTA. It stands for None of The Above. Hence if none of the candidates fit into<br>
				your criteria, just hit the NOTA option and voice the opinion. Introduction of this alternative is believed to play a significant<br>
				role in the future. In the late future, it may also be possible that the NOTA will decide the re-elections with fresh candidates.</p>
			 <h2 class="lead">A Sense Of Pride</h2>
			 <p>We must honor the right of voting given by the constitution of India. The youngsters are well excited to exercise their right<br>
			    to vote as soon as they turn 18. The feeling after having cast a vote infuses a sense of pride for being a responsible citizen.<br> 
				As can be witnessed from the sharing of the inked finger on social media. The trend is continuing to gain popularity amongst the<br> 
				youngers and the elders as well.<br>
                <br>
				Gone are the days when it was required for people to motivate them to vote. The vote share for the General Election of 2014<br> 
				was 8% higher than the previous election. Voter turnout in the Lok Sabha Election 2019 was 67%. Voter awareness program<br>
				has become successful in its mission and the vote share continues to increase till date in many state elections. With this<br>
				increasing number of voter turnout, we will soon reach the 80-90% golden mark.<br></p>
