# CS-Project-Sem-1
These are all the source code files that me (Kartik Gupta(2K20/B8/51) and my partner Naman(2K20/B8/64) have made for our CO101 innovative project.
The Website is currently optimised for viewing only on laptop or pc screen sizes.
• Our website is basically a Voting Portal that me and my partner have 
designed. It has a navbar on the top to navigate between the Home, 
Signup and the Login pages.
• The signup page can be used by the voter to register themselves for voting 
by submitting the details like name, voter-id, contact and password for 
logging in.
• The signup details are stored in a SQL database named “SignupDatabase”.
• The Signup form is connected to this database using php.
• The login page can be used to login into the user module.
• On logging in the voter gets a form to vote for their choice of Party and 
even a N.O.T.A option.
• The entire interface has been made in a very attractive and user-friendly 
manner. So that voters can cast their votes easily.
• The entire portal has been hosted on Github Pages for the examiner to 
have a look at. (Unfortunately, GitHub Pages does not support backend 
server tools. So the examiner can view only the backend source code files.)
